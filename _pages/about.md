# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm **Arjun**

I‚Äôm a graduate‚Äëstudent researcher at NYU interested in **LLMs, Agents, and Visual Spatial Understanding of Multimodal Models**.

---

## üî≠ Current Work

- **Multi‚Äëagent LLM coordination (Advisor: [Dr.&nbsp;Karthik¬†Narsimhan](https://karthikncode.github.io/))** ‚Äî Working at Princeton NLP Group to  
  - design **Agent Context Protocols (ACPs)** that execute **Directed Acyclic Graph‚Äëstructured** workflows and dynamically equip each agent with the right tool (web search, Python, filesystem, Google¬†APIs, etc) through **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** servers.

- **Multimodal spatial understanding** ‚Äî Post‚Äëtraining **DINOv2, CLIP, and SigLIP** like models with **language‚Äëguided visual grounding** techniques; constructing a dense local‚Äëregion¬†‚Üî¬†caption dataset via an automated pipeline that pairs **Llama‚ÄëVision‚ÄëInstruct** with **Segment Anything Model¬†2** to generate fine‚Äëgrained dataset.

- **Liver-based Disease Detection using MultiModal Models (Advisor: [Dr.&nbsp;Sumit¬†Chopra](https://www.spchopra.net/#projects))** ‚Äî Developing Liver Fibrosis Detection using MultiModal models with collaboration radiologists at NYU Langone Health. Developing an automated dataset generation pipeline using LLMs for extractig data from Radiology Reports and EHR Data.

---

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ Previous Research Experience
- **Serre¬†Lab, Brown¬†University (Advisor: [Dr.&nbsp;Thomas¬†Serre](https://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/research/))** ‚Äî Worked on building Neuro‚ÄëInspired Vision Models for Scale-Invariant Object Detection.

<h2 style="font-size: larger;"><strong>Projects:</strong></h2>
- **Understanding the Effects Of RLHF and DPO on LLMs**:Analyzed the impact of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) on LLMs‚Äô output generalization and diversity by fine-tuning the Mistral-7B-v0.1 model for summarization tasks using advanced techniques like PEFT LoRA adapters and 4-bit quantization [Github](https://github.com/PranavGrandhi/DPO_RLHF).
- **Advanced Music Generation using Language Models**: Developed a Transformer-XL based Language Model for generating novel multi-instrument music compositions. Integrated Vector Quantised Variational Auto Encoder for high-fidelity, diverse music generation, achieving near-lossless 6x audio compression for efficient training and inference [Github](https://github.com/AniketRajpoot/DeepMusicGeneration).
- **Text-To-SQL Context-Aware Query System**: Created a Text-to-SQL system utilizing LLMs augmented with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate context aware SQL queries. Performed Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) of Llama2-7b using LoRA adapters on WikiSQL & Spider datasets and created a user-friendly interface for querying and interacting with IPEDS [Github](https://github.com/AnanyaSSadana/text-to-sql-llm/tree/main).
- **Loan Default Prediction System**: Deployed an end-to-end machine learning application for Loan Default prediction using Kubernetes and Docker. Conducted data preprocessing and trained an XGBoost classifier, utilizing the daal4Py library for accelerated inference. Leveraged AWS services (EKS, ECR, EC2, ELB) for optimized performance and scalability [Github](https://github.com/arjunsinghrathore/Loan-Default-Prediction-System).
- **Content-Based Music Recommendation System**: Implemented a content-based music recommendation system using Apache Kafka for streaming data, PySpark for data processing, and Spark SQL for querying structured data. Utilized MLlib for KMeans and PCA analysis on the Spotify Tracks Dataset, and visualized results with Streamlit, recommending similar songs based on liked playlists [Github](https://github.com/AnanyaSSadana/music-recommendation-system/tree/main).
- **CineConnect WebApp**: Built CineConnect, a scalable movie-sharing website using a microservices architecture. Utilized React for the front end and Node.js for the back end, deployed on AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) with EC2 instances. Implemented MongoDB for user data and movie metadata management, enhancing performance and reliability [Github](https://github.com/arjunsinghrathore/movie-website).
- **Geo-Notes**: A digital diary that anchors your memories to geographical locations, transforming the world into a canvas for your stories. Discover more about this enchanting way to capture your life's moments [Geo-Notes Web Page](https://geo-notes-unique123-9b77e082dace.herokuapp.com/).
