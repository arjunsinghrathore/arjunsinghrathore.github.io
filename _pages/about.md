I'm Arjun, currently at the exciting intersection of machine learning, software engineering, and cognitive science as I pursue my Master's in Computer Science at NYU. From my electrical engineering roots at IIT Palakkad to my current research, I've been fortunate to work with leading minds at renowned labs like the Serre Lab at Brown University and with Dr. Leon Axel at NYU and Dr. Dimitri Metaxas at Rutgers. My work spans from developing scale-invariant deep learning models that delve into the cognitive aspects of vision to creating synthetic cardiac MRI videos for medical research, showcasing the potential of AI in healthcare. I'm also passionate about software development, demonstrated through projects like Geo-Notes, which connects memories to places. Balancing rigorous academic research with practical tech solutions, I'm dedicated to making an impact through innovation and real-world applications.
