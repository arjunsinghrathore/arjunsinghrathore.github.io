collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for subject-independent emotion recognition using EEG data. It employs an unsupervised LSTM with a channel-attention autoencoder to extract subject-invariant features, followed by a CNN with an attention mechanism for emotion classification. This approach shows promising results across various datasets, achieving state-of-the-art accuracies and demonstrating the potential for a comprehensive tool for EEG analysis that doesn't rely on hand-engineered features.'

This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for subject-independent emotion recognition using EEG data. It employs an unsupervised LSTM with a channel-attention autoencoder to extract subject-invariant features, followed by a CNN with an attention mechanism for emotion classification. This approach shows promising results across various datasets, achieving state-of-the-art accuracies and demonstrating the potential for a comprehensive tool for EEG analysis that doesn't rely on hand-engineered features.
