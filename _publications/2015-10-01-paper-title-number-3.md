CoGraph is introduced as a comprehensive hybrid database, combining data and knowledge from major conferences in Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, and AI. It spans over 40 years and includes a vast array of conference publications. The database facilitates the analysis of conceptual trends and the evolution of ideas within these fields, leveraging data like publications, authors, and keywords to construct temporal networks and graphs, offering insights into the dynamic landscape of scientific research and idea exchange.
