This research explores the use of deep learning and attention mechanisms in EEG-based emotion recognition, presenting two novel vision transformer-based methods that analyze both wavelet-transformed and raw EEG signals. Utilizing the DEAP dataset, the study achieves remarkable accuracies exceeding 95% for both valence and arousal classifications, underscoring the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in this context. These advancements promise faster processing times, making them viable for clinical applications like music-based therapy.
